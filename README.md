# Search-Query-Anomaly-Detection
The Search Query Anomaly Detection project focuses on identifying irregular or unexpected patterns in search queries to flag potential anomalies. These anomalies may indicate unusual behavior, such as a technical issue, user errors, or malicious activities like bot attacks or fraud. The goal of the project is to build a machine learning-based model that can effectively detect and classify search query anomalies.
Potential Applications:
Search Engines: To monitor and maintain the integrity of search engine queries by detecting unusual patterns.
E-commerce: To identify and mitigate bot attacks or fraudulent activities in search queries.
Web Analytics: To ensure the quality and reliability of search query data for insights and decision-making.
